SmartCityProject
================

The SmartCity Project is a small scale model of an IoT city with autonomous vehicles and other city facilities
controlled by our own developed cloud platform. The main goal of this project is to build a heterogeneous
distributed environment which includes the integration of real-time embedded systems (e.g. cars, traffic-lights)
with the cloud software. This system is developed for educational purposes.


SmartCity Modules
=================

 - SmartCity Core: is the hearth of the distributed system. This module controls the access to the database.
 - SmartCity Central: is a webservice which provides a web front-end to request the status of the SmartCity Core on a user friendly dashboard.
 - SmartCity Viewer: this module creates a visual representation of the physical map. It shows all bots in the SmartCity on the map.


SimCity Modules
===============

 - SimCity: is a webservice which provides a web front-end to control the SimBots on the different SimCity Workers.
 - SimCity Worker: this module allow to initialise and run simulation of bots in the SmartCity environment.
